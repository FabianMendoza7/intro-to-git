- Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes made to their codebase over time.

- Git is the gateway to GitHub, an online platform.
- Treat your GitHub as an extension of your LinkedIn (you need a Job).

Using GitHub
- Create a repo on GitHub (remote repository)
- Create a repo in your file system (local repository)
	• A folder for a project
	• Initiate a new repo
- Connect them using the url provided by GitHub

Basic commands
- Go to your project folder
- Right-click on it and open on Integrated terminal

Config git:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.mail "fmendoza.ospina7@outlook.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global --list

Connect repos local and remote:
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/FabianMendoza7/intro-to-git.git (this is the bridge between your local and remotes repos)
git remote -v


Add, Commit, Push
Commit means to create a save point in your project history

git add .
git commit -m 'Comment'
git push -u origin master
